## 🧾 Overview

TaxFlow is a web application designed to assist users—especially in Morocco—in estimating, planning, and understanding their tax obligations. This platform offers tools and resources that simplify tax calculations, demystify tax concepts, and help users optimize their fiscal situation in a legally compliant way.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Tax Guide / Resources** — Step-by-step explanations of tax terms, typical deductions, filing rules, and strategies relevant to the Moroccan tax system
- **Scenario Comparison** — Compare different tax scenarios side by side (e.g. with/without deductions, different income sources)
- **Responsive UI / UX** — Clean, mobile-friendly interface with smooth transitions and intuitive navigation
- **Localization & Language** — Content primarily in French (or bilingual if needed), tailored to the Moroccan context
- **Brand Cohesion** — Shares styling and theming conventions with sister projects (like LoanFlow) to maintain consistency across domains

## 🎯 Purpose & Role

The goal of TaxFlow is to:

- **Empower taxpayers** — provide clarity and transparency around tax obligations and rights
- **Simplify calculations** — make it easy for non-experts to get realistic estimates
- **Promote tax literacy** — explain key concepts in everyday language
- **Support financial planning** — help users model their net incomes under different scenarios (before/after tax)
